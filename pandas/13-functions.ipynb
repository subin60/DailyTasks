If you assign a name in any way within a def, it will become a local to that function by default.\n","\n","In-place changes to objects do not classify names as locals; only actual name assignments do. \n","\n","For instance, if the name L is assigned to a list at the top level of a module, a statement L = X within a function will classify L as a local, but L.append(X) will not. In the latter case, we are changing the list object that L references, not L itself—L is found in the global scope as usual, and Python happily modifies it without requiring a global (or nonlocal) declaration. As usual, it helps to keep the distinction between names and objects clear: changing an object is not an assignment to a name."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tEjCdIPJKhZ0"},"outputs":[],"source":["L = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","def append4():\n","    L.append(4)\n","    return L\n","\n","append4()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"38i3oE9JKhZ1"},"outputs":[],"source":["L"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"V0STK6hgKhZ1"},"outputs":[],"source":["L = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","def transform_L_into_X():\n","    X = \"This is X\"\n","    L = X\n","    return L\n","\n","transform_L_into_X()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"QpNyLq1sKhZ1"},"outputs":[],"source":["L"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"F2EgGqYwKhZ1"},"source":["#### The global statement"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"b0V8mYwbKhZ1"},"outputs":[],"source":["X = 88                         # Global X\n","\n","def func():\n","    global X\n","    X = 99                     # Global X: outside def\n","    print(X)\n","\n","func()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uWB7RXzNKhZ1"},"outputs":[],"source":["X"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dk4boxILKhZ2"},"source":["Minimize globals!
